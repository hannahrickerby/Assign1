      <h1>About me</h1>

        <h2>"If it doesn't work turn it on and off, then if that doesn't work, hit it, after that I dont yet know,
          I'm a computing student not a wizard!" Hannah Rickerby 2016</h2>

        <p>I'm a computing student at Northampton University, when my flat mates heard I was a computing student they
           automatically think I can fix every single technical problem they have, which wasn't the case and where the
           above came from. Although highly amusing I hope that furhter into my University education I will be able to
           say that and then actually solve their problem from my learning withing the class room environtment.</p>

        <p>I'm a very enthusiastic person and I'm always up for learning new things, my previous computing education was
           didn't include much of the coding and in my first tirm of Uni I have already very quickly picked up the basics
           of different coding language and put them into practise in seminar and practical work and in assignments.
           I love being part of a team, I'm a good team player who can take control when needed, working with a group of
           people to create a project is something we immediately encountered in our first term and we have taken on the
           task and have produced great outcomes.</p>

        <p>Academically I have always found ICT something that came more natural to me than other subjects did but my love
          for computing and all things technology and gadget also came from my Dad and Brother. My Dad has always worked in
          networking and computing and bought his love of technology home cosnstantly buying new gadgets and things for us
          to play with. My Brother I am pretty much following on in his footsteps, he completed a similar computing course
          as Uni and now has found a job doing what he enjoys in computing in the heart of London. It's meant I've always
          been learning about little things when at home.</p>

       <p>I'm not only about technology and computing though, I enjoy being around my friends and having fun with a group of
         people I really know. I danced for 10 years in one dance school, did 13 dance exams and 5 shows in that time. I like
         to read and watch tv, the normal things of an 18 year old.</p>
