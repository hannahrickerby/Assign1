1. Colour scheme chosen off designschool.canva.com
2. Started index form and CSS. File, creating new ones to prepare my website
3. Linked the CSS style sheet names style.css to my index page
4. Entered the code for header, main body and footer onto my index page, then
   set up the layout for these 3 elements on my css. File
5. Entered a <h1> element onto my index page, found a font off google fonts which
   was then inputted into the index file through a href link to be able to change
   the font into the one I have chosen
6. Linked this font into the CSS. file and created a h1 style
7. Created an unordered list using the <ul> tag for my navigation bar and then
   <li> tags to carry on my list, tried to implement this into the middle of my
    website but was unable to do this or move it.
8. changed the design layout and moved the unordered list into the already made
   header
9. Wanted to add on more feature to my navigation bar and so searched the internet
   for help, found extra feature on w3schools, these include the hover over effect
10. Input the correct information to link these such as the hover over colour onto
    the css form.
11. Input a self picture onto my index page, one that was taken by me and saved on
    my laptop.
12. Used Jon Ducketts book, html + css to get the code to centre the picture in the
    css
13. Copied the basic layout of the header, footer and main body I had created on the
    index page onto all the other pages to keep the website consistent
14. Using previous code we had created in class, created a 'Left column' using the
    article attribute, this is a different colour so it stands out
15. Created a small index in this left column on the CV page so that it will link to
    information that is on that page easily, making the navigation simple
16. Used the same book as previous by Jon Duckett to create find the code I needed to
    input that will link two items on one page together and then input this into my
    cv code
17. Created a cv bar class setting in CSS to link the two together
18. Created a new heading 2 setting in my css style sheet that will be used throughout
    the website to change the font
19. Imported a new font but to begin with the code would not picked this up, had to
    rearrange my css file for this code to be picked up as something was over riding
    the heading font that I was trying to set
20. Started on my contact me page, used W3 schools again to learn how to create a
    static form which the user of the website can send me an email with a comment
    straight to my email address
21. Input this code to create the static form
22. Searched Pixabay website for images that are icons of the phone and email to create
    links on my webpage
