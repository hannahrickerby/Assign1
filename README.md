01. Colour scheme chosen off designschool.canva.com
02. Started index and CSS. , creating new ones to prepare my website
03. Linked the CSS style sheet names style.css to my index page
04. Entered code for header, main body and footer onto my index page, then
   set up the layout for these 3 elements on css. File
05. Entered a <h1> element onto my index page, found a font off google fonts which
   then input into the index file through a href link to be able to change
   the font into the one I have chosen
06. Linked this font into the CSS. and created a h1 style
07. Created an unordered list using the <ul> tag for my navigation bar and then
   <li> tags to carry on my list, tried to implement this into the middle of my
    website but was unable to do this or move it.
08. changed the design layout and moved the unordered list into the already made
   header
09. Wanted to add on features to my navigation bar and so searched the internet
   for help, found extra on w3schools, these include the hover over effect
10. Input the information to link these such as the hover over colour onto
    the css form.
11. Input a picture onto my index, one that was taken by me and saved on
    my laptop.
12. Used Jon Ducketts book, html + css to get the code to centre the picture in the
    css
13. Copied the basic layout of the index page onto all the other pages to keep the
    website consistent
26/11/16 - 3 Hours
14. Using previous code we had created in class, created a 'Left column' using the
    article attribute, this is a different colour so it stands out
15. Created a small index in this left column on the CV page so that it will link to
    information that is on that page easily, making the navigation simple
16. Used the book as previous by Jon Duckett to find the code I needed to
    input that will link two items on one page together and input this into my
    cv code
17. Created a cv bar class setting in CSS to link the two together
29/11/16 - 3 Hours
18. Created a new heading 2 setting in my css style sheet that will be used throughout
    the website to change the font
19. Imported a new font but  the code would not pick this up, had to
    rearrange my css  for this code to work as something was over riding
    the heading font that I was trying to set
20. Started my contact page, used W3 schools to add a static form
21. Input this code to create the static form
22. Searched Pixabay website for icons of the phone and email to create
    links on my webpage, and downloaded these
23. Input images onto 'cv' atom page, found images were too large, set 'height and
    width' for image
24. Wrote info on 'cv' page about me
25. Input breaks and paragraph tags to separate the information
26. Write information on bio in 'paragraph' elements
27. Decided website looked strange with just large amounts of text and so input the
    'left article column' into about me page onto all but the index page
28. Adapted classes and the css style to make the left article column fit correctly
    on all the pages
30/11/16 - 2 Hours
29. Started Readme file
30. Changed the colour scheme as the colours were too dark, these ones are
    more appropriate for the internet
31. Removed the panel off the cv page as had 2 navigation bars, edited
    and removed it
32. Introduced divs into my work so I could create the divides and easily move parts
    on my website together, such as all the writing on one page where there's
    different heading and paragraph tags
33. Changed the left article column on all the pages and added one onto the index page to
    prevent the floating footer, made the article column smaller and sit into the page
    instead of it floating as this is apparently very old school
34. Used the div on the CV page to moved all the writing to the centre so even amounts of space
13/12/16 - 2 Hours
35. Removed form on contact page, used online guide and Jon Duckett book to
    create a new form from scratch
36. Used the book to add a legend and fieldset to my form and changed the layout and
    look of it on my css file
37. Added in a meta tag to scale page to fit best on what it's being viewed on
38. Added 3 media queries based on a laptop, tablet and phone to break the page up
